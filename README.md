Composing Digital Media Project 3: Job Seeking Portfolio

November 9, 2022: 

For my web portfolio, I plan to draft a collection of my works to demonstrate my digital skills for potential employers.  Looking to go into digital media, journalism, film, or the like, I plan to have an easily navigable collection of my skills as a sample for employers to browse through to view me as a strong candidate.  Attached I have a few skeleton files and a style map of how I plan to set up my website.  In terms of aesthetics and CSS design, I plan to have a clean and minimalistic layout with whites and varying shades of blues, with simple and complementary fonts throughout.

At this point, I think I have all my links and such in place...  I plan to finalize some aesthetic details and double and triple check that all of my links are in working order.  I've been struggling a bit to complete all of the CSS detailing that I plan to have for my final submission, but will be using the final week before it is due to complete all the remaining bells and whistles.
