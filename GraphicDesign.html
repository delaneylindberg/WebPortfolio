  <h3>Additional Design Projects</h3>
    <p>Delaney finds pride in her attention to detail and aetheticism, and for all projects she works on, she ensures perfectionism and clean, appealing designs.  Check out additional miscellaneous design work below.</p>

    <p><b><i>LGBTQ+ Individuals in Catholic Schools,</i> Presentation</b></p>
      <p>In this presentation, Delaney summarizes the highlights found in her literature review of the same topic, which can be found <a href="WritingSamples/LitReview.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> or with her other works under the <a href="Writing.html">Writing</a> tab.<p>

    <p><b><i>Visual Culture Journal,</i> Presentation</b></p>
      <p>For this project, Delaney was tasked with detailing intriguing visual culture items found in everyday life and media.  To balance the various unique items captured, she designed the project with a minimalistic style.</p>

    <p><b><i>Visual Argument Project</i></b></p>
      <p>Inspired by an exhibit capturing outfits victims of assault wore at the time of their assault, Delaney used screenshots from a Twitter thread to highlight the harm involved in victim blaming, specifically in asking victims the question, "What were you wearing?"</p>
